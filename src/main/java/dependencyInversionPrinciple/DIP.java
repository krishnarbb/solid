// Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
// In other words, dependencies on interfaces and supertypes is better than dependencies on concrete types.

// Inversion of Control (IOC) is actual process of creating abstractions and 
// getting them to replace dependencies.

// Dependency Injection is the use of software frameworks to ensure that  a component's 
// dependencies are satisfied.
