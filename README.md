# SOLID principles

Single Responsibility Principle 

	A class should have a single responsibility.

Open-Closed Principle

	Entities should be Open for Extension, but Closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle

	Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering program correctness.

Interface Segregation Principle
	
	Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface

Dependency Inversion Principle

	Dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete.



The source code contains Design patterns to implement the above Principles.
